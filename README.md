# JavaMinigames
### Description
JavaMinigames is a collection of local games against a computer opponent, which I am developing as supplementary practice to COP 3330 at UCF. When completed, it will include tictactoe, chess, and checkers. GUI developed with Swing.
### Installation
No builds are currently availble. These will be added as the project progresses.
